# Event `grokbot-kit.event/v1`

> Leia em português: [pt-BR/event.md](pt-BR/event.md)

Every event `grokbot-kit` sends to the route of a target is one JSON object with the 26 fields below, always present
(a field with no value is `null`). The JSON Schema is
[`src/grokbot_kit/assets/event.v1.json`](../src/grokbot_kit/assets/event.v1.json). While the version is `0.x` the
schema may change, always with an entry in the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Events and status

A task sends exactly one terminal event (`completed`, `error` or `timeout`), plus one `needs_input` event each time the
agent stops at a permission prompt or a question. `grokbot-kit route test` sends a `test` event, whose task fields are
`null`.

| `event` | `status` | `exit_reason` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `completed` | `ok`: the agent finished | `success` |
| `completed` | `denied`: the agent finished, but a permission was denied along the way | `permission_denied` |
| `error` | `failed` | `agent_error` (the CLI reported an error), `nonzero_exit`, or `result_invalid` (a plugin task whose result does not match the plugin's schema) |
| `error` | `interrupted`: the task got `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` | `interrupted` |
| `timeout` | `timeout`: the task ran past `--timeout` | `timeout` |
| `needs_input` | `permission` or `question` | `needs_input` |
| `test` | `test` | `null` |
